[Gm]We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline [F] [Gm]
To make records [Gm]with a mobile
We [F]didn't have muc[Gm]h time
[Gm]Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best pla[F]ce around [Gm]
[Gm]But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground [F] [Gm]

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky [C] [Ab] [G]
Smoke on the water [C] [Ab]

(Intro Riff 2x)

[Gm]They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful so[F]und [Gm]
[Gm]Funky and Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids ou[F]t the ground [Gm]


[Gm]When it all was over
We had to find another pla[F]ce [Gm]
[Gm]But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race [F] [Gm]

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky [C] [Ab] [G]
Smoke on the water [C] [Ab]

(Intro Riff 2X avec fin du solo)

[Gm]We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empt[F]y cold an[Gm]d bare
[Gm]But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Ma[F]king our music there [Gm]
[Gm]With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to s[F]weat [Gm]
[Gm]No matter what we get out of this
I know I know [F]we'll neve[Gm]r forget

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky [C] [Ab] [G]
Smoke on the water [C] [Ab]
